To avoid this, I propose implementing default configurations that strike a balance for optimal functionality without the burden of excessive choices.\n\n- **Complexity Issues**:\n    - Excessive settings can create a labyrinthine user experience.\n    - Navigating through too many options can overwhelm users.\n\n- **Preferred Approach**:\n    - Setting up standardized defaults that work well for a majority of users.\n    - Ensuring a straightforward, user-friendly interface for intuitive support.\n\nBy simplifying to essential defaults, we can enhance usability while maintaining an accessible support framework.",

Understanding this aspect helps gauge the effectiveness of your solutions in real-world scenarios.\n\nBy emphasizing these metrics over average response time, we ensure that the bakeoff results provide a complete picture of performance quality.",
