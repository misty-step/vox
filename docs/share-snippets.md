**Show HN: Vox – fast, privacy-first dictation for macOS**

> Vox is a menu bar dictation app that pipes audio through a resilient STT chain (ElevenLabs → Deepgram → Apple on-device) with optional LLM rewrite. No cloud dependency required; on-device mode works fully offline on macOS 26+.
>
> Trigger: Option+Space. Result pastes directly into the focused field.
>
> Source + release: https://github.com/misty-step/vox

## Reddit (r/macapps, r/MacOS)

> **Vox – keyboard-driven dictation for macOS (open source)**
>
> Been building this for a while and figured I'd share. It's a menu bar app: hold Option+Space to record, release to transcribe and paste. Supports cloud STT (ElevenLabs, Deepgram) with Apple on-device fallback.
>
> Main differentiator: fully offline capable on macOS 26+ using Apple's SpeechTranscriber, and a sequential-fallback STT chain so it degrades gracefully instead of failing silently.
