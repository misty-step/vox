# Planning Packet — Misty Step Vox (Desktop MVP)

Measure twice, cut once. Planning docs only, no code.

## Goals
- One-path UX, zero-config
- Low latency, high trust
- Swappable providers behind stable contracts
- Minimal complexity, deep modules

## Doc map
- `docs/plan/product-brief.md` — thesis, UX loop, guardrails
- `docs/plan/requirements.md` — goals, non-goals, NFRs
- `docs/plan/architecture.md` — components, contracts, routing
- `docs/plan/macos-client.md` — app behavior + OS integration
- `docs/plan/backend.md` — gateway scope, endpoints, ops
- `docs/plan/verification-and-safety.md` — no-hallucination plan
- `docs/plan/testing-and-eval.md` — test lists + metrics
- `docs/plan/roadmap-mvp.md` — milestones, exit criteria, risks

## Rules of the road
- Prefer deletion over addition
- Hard contracts, soft providers
- Capability flags, not provider names
- Fast path always exists
