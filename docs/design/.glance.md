## Purpose
This directory contains design documentation and layout explorations for the application's user interface. Its primary focus is on reducing perceived complexity through the evaluation of different settings configurations while maintaining existing backend behaviors.

## Key Roles
- `209-settings-layout-exploration.md`: Documents the evaluation of three layout designs (Single Page, Sidebar Categories, and Setup Wizard) and records the decision to implement a single-page layout with progressive disclosure.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- The design must preserve existing Keychain and environment variable override behaviors.
- The chosen layout requires a "Manage Keys" sheet to handle provider details without adding new primary settings surfaces.
- System functionality relies on Apple Speech for on-device transcription by default.
- Cloud providers, including Gemini and OpenRouter, are treated as optional enhancements for speed and quality.
- The interface is designed around a specific hotkey (Option+Space) and microphone selection for immediate utility.
- Implementation avoids `NavigationSplitView` and multi-step state flows to minimize UI machinery and navigation costs.
