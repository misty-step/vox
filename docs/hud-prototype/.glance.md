## Purpose
This directory contains a prototype for the "Vox HUD," a visual interface design for monitoring audio-related states. The prototype simulates a state machine that transitions through recording, processing, and completion phases. It uses web technologies to demonstrate UI animations, including a breathing recording indicator, a progress spinner, and a success checkmark.

## Key Roles
- **final.html**: A standalone HTML document that defines the HUD structure, styles, and animation logic. It manages transitions between "recording," "processing," and "done" states using JavaScript and the GSAP library.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- **GSAP (v3.12)**: External dependency loaded via CDN for timeline management and SVG animations.
- **State Cycle**: The UI automatically cycles through predefined states (recording for 4000ms, processing for 3000ms, and done for 2000ms) via a recursive `setTimeout` loop.
- **SVG Graphics**: Icons for the spinner and checkmark are defined as inline SVG elements with specific stroke and dash properties for animation.
- **Motion Accessibility**: Includes a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query that forces animation and transition durations to zero.
- **Timer Logic**: The recording state utilizes a `setInterval` function to increment and format a text-based timer (MM:SS).
- **Typography**: Relies on system font stacks including San Francisco, SF Mono, and standard monospace fallbacks.
