# Vision

## One-Liner
macOS dictation utility that replaces your keyboard with your voice - SuperWhisper, but simpler.

## North Star
The primary means of writing on the computer. Keyboard almost fully replaced by voice. Daily driver status already achieved; next level is any MRR proving others find it compelling too.

## Key Differentiators
- **Radical simplicity** - SuperWhisper has too many bells and whistles. Vox should feel like a native Apple app with minimal configuration.
- **Three processing levels, nothing else** - Off (raw transcript), Light (punctuation, formatting, structure), Aggressive (tightest, densest, most articulate form of what you meant).
- **Works out of the box** - No model selectors, no fiddling. Just works.
- **Design excellence** - Cleaner, more compelling UI/UX than competitors.

## Target User
Power users who write a lot and want to talk instead of type. Initially: the developer. Eventually: anyone frustrated by SuperWhisper's complexity.

## Current Focus
**Phase 1: Engineering Fundamentals**
- Better tests, monitoring, observability
- Error logging, quality gates
- Custom domain setup

**Phase 2: Launch Readiness**
- Stripe integration, monetization
- Security (server-side secrets, no local API keys)
- Working paywall

**Phase 3: Growth**
- Compelling landing page
- Automated marketing loop driving traffic

**Phase 4: Polish**
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimization
- Model research for speed/quality balance
