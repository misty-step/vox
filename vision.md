# Vision

## One-Liner
Voice-to-text with optional AI polish — from raw transcript to refined prose.

## North Star
The invisible writing assistant. Press hotkey, speak naturally, get text your way. No configuration maze, no learning curve, no friction. Just works.

## Key Differentiators
- **Rewrite as first-class feature** — Light cleanup, aggressive refinement, or raw transcript. Your choice.
- **Zero configuration** — Works perfectly out of the box, BYOK simplicity
- **World-class UX** — Delightful interactions, not feature sprawl
- **Open source core** — Community-driven, extensible, trustworthy

## Target User
Writers, developers, knowledge workers who dictate frequently. People frustrated by:
- Apps with too many settings and modes
- Subscription fatigue for simple tools
- Clunky, dated interfaces

## Competitive Position
SuperWhisper alternative that's simpler and smarter:
- Fewer bells and whistles, more polish
- Rewrite options that actually work well
- Open source transparency vs closed black box

## Current Focus (Q1 2026)
1. **Polish the core experience** — HUD, menu bar, hotkey feel buttery smooth
2. **Performance** — Shave milliseconds from transcription and rewrite
3. **Design identity** — Distinctive brand, icon, visual language
4. **Documentation** — README, contributing guide, architecture docs
5. **Modularity** — Clean architecture that enables future Vox Pro wrapper

## Architecture Principle
Designed for composition. Vox is the engine; a future managed service (Vox Pro/Cloud) should be a thin wrapper that imports Vox and adds auth/billing/sync. The open source version must be complete and useful on its own.
