## Purpose
This directory contains template configuration files used for the release and packaging of the Vox application. It specifically provides the structure for macOS application metadata and permission declarations.

## Key Roles
- `Info.plist.template`: Defines the property list structure for the macOS application bundle, including placeholders for versioning and identification, as well as required system usage descriptions.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- The `Info.plist.template` contains placeholders (`__VOX_BUNDLE_ID__`, `__VOX_APP_VERSION__`, and `__VOX_BUILD_NUMBER__`) that must be substituted during the build or release process.
- Requires a minimum system version of macOS 14.0.
- Configures the application as an agent or background app via the `LSUIElement` key.
- Explicitly defines usage descriptions for microphone access and speech recognition.
