## Purpose
This directory provides a suite of automation tools for testing, quality assurance, performance benchmarking, and macOS application release. It includes scripts for calculating code coverage, linting workflows, evaluating external AI providers for transcription and rewriting, and managing GitHub Pull Request feedback. The directory also contains templates and procedures for building, signing, and notarizing the production macOS application bundle.

## Key Roles
- `coverage-report.sh` and `post-coverage-comment.sh`: Generate test coverage metrics and synchronize them to GitHub PRs via sticky comments using HTML markers.
- `release-macos.sh` and `release/Info.plist.template`: Orchestrate the build, code-signing, notarization, and metadata configuration for the macOS application.
- `rewrite-bakeoff.py` and `stt-eval.py`: Benchmark and compare external LLM and STT providers for latency, cost, and quality metrics.
- `benchmark.sh` and `test-audio-guardrails.sh`: Execute targeted performance benchmarks and functional test suites for the processing pipeline.
- `lint.sh` and `lint-cerberus-workflow.sh`: Enforce code style and validate GitHub Action workflow contracts.
- `run-tests-ci.sh`: Manages the execution of the test suite within CI environments, including timeout handling and process cleanup.
- `backfill-perf-audit.sh` and `format-perf-report.py`: Retrieve and process performance data into formatted reports featuring statistical distributions.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `jq` for API interactions, artifact retrieval, and JSON payload construction.
- Release and audio fixture scripts depend on macOS-specific utilities including `codesign`, `xcrun`, `notarytool`, `say`, and `afconvert`.
- `stt-eval.py` and `rewrite-bakeoff.py` require valid API keys for external providers such as OpenRouter, Deepgram, OpenAI, and Groq.
- Code coverage and benchmarking rely on `swift test` with specific configurations like `--enable-code-coverage` and `-Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`.
- The `Info.plist.template` requires substitution of placeholders (e.g., `__VOX_BUNDLE_ID__`) during the build process.
- Coverage reporting enforces specific minimum percentage thresholds for core modules, including `VoxCore` and `VoxPipeline`.
- Workflow linting utilizes an external validator script fetched from a remote Cerberus repository.
- Application execution via `run.sh` relies on a local `.env.local` file for environment variable configuration.
