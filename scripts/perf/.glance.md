## Purpose
This directory contains scripts for managing performance auditing, fixture generation, and reporting. It provides tools to generate standardized audio test inputs, process raw performance JSON data into formatted Markdown reports, and synchronize these results with GitHub Pull Requests and audit repositories. The suite supports tracking metrics across different execution "lanes," specifically live network timing and deterministic mock timing.

## Key Roles
- `backfill-perf-audit.sh`: Scans GitHub workflow runs to retrieve performance artifacts and uploads them to a dedicated audit repository.
- `format-perf-report.py`: Processes performance JSON data to calculate statistical distributions (p50, p95) and generates Markdown reports featuring Mermaid trend charts and optional LLM-based synthesis.
- `make-fixture-audio.sh`: Generates deterministic 16kHz mono CAF audio files using macOS system tools to serve as standardized test inputs.
- `post-pr-comment.sh`: Manages "sticky" performance audit comments on GitHub Pull Requests by updating existing entries or posting new ones based on a specific metadata marker.
- `write-skip-report.sh`: Produces a standardized Markdown report for skipped audit runs, including instructions for local manual execution.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for API interactions, artifact retrieval, and pull request commenting.
- `format-perf-report.py` depends on Python 3 and can optionally interface with the OpenRouter API for result synthesis.
- `make-fixture-audio.sh` is dependent on macOS-specific utilities `say` and `afconvert`.
- Performance analysis distinguishes between "Provider" (live network) and "Codepath" (deterministic mock) lanes.
- Data processing relies on a specific JSON schema containing fields such as `commitSHA`, `generatedAt`, `p95`, and `fixtureResults`.
- Uses the `jq` utility for JSON parsing and payload construction within Bash scripts.
- GitHub API operations require a valid `GH_TOKEN` environment variable.
- PR comment management utilizes the `<!-- vox-perf-audit -->` HTML marker to identify and deduplicate performance reports.
