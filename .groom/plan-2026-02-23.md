# Grooming Plan — 2026-02-23

## Themes Explored

| Theme | Direction Locked |
|-------|-----------------|
| T1: UX Transparency | PipelineStage enum + HUD stage labels + "Done (Raw)" fallback signal |
| T2: Honest Onboarding | Default to .raw when hasRewrite==false; per-mode readiness display |
| T3: Distribution | DMG workflow triggered on release; all 9 secrets already exist |
| T4: VoxSession Debt | Extract embedded types; fix SecureFileDeleter; add pipeline test gaps |
| T5: Rewrite Intelligence | Spike (blocked by #259 bakeoff) |

## Issues Created

| # | Title | Priority | Horizon | Score |
|---|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| #304 | PipelineStage enum for HUD transparency | P2 | next | ~85 |
| #305 | Fix default processing level + onboarding readiness | P2 | next | ~85 |
| #306 | Notarized DMG + auto-upload to GitHub Releases | P2 | now | ~85 |
| #307 | Fix SecureFileDeleter error propagation | P2 | next | ~85 |
| #308 | Extract StreamingAudioBridge + StreamingSessionPump | P3 | later | ~80 |
| #309 | DictationPipeline test coverage gaps | P2 | next | ~82 |
| #310 | Spike: AX API context routing (blocked by #259) | P3 | later | ~75 |

## Deferred

- Power Mode / advanced settings path — respects ADR-0001; needs ADR first
- Public performance dashboard — later; needs ingest infra (#275)
- GitHub Discussions / Discord — launch decision, not engineering

## Key Research Findings

- Thinktank (7/8 models): Use typed PipelineStage enum not string callback; "Done (Raw)" over char counts
- Root T2 fix: change default level to .raw when hasRewrite==false — one line, eliminates silent failure
- DMG: all 9 secrets already configured; ~20 lines needed
- DictationPipeline has 37 tests (more than initial assessment); gaps are TTL/concurrent/timeout

## Backlog Hygiene Applied

- #296 (Keychain debounce): added milestone + labels
- #293 (Recovery menu TTL): added milestone + labels
- vision.md migrated → project.md (richer format)

## Recommended Execution Order

1. #306 (DMG) — now, effort/s, unblocks distribution immediately
2. #305 (Onboarding default fix) — next, effort/s, eliminates silent first-run failure
3. #307 (SecureFileDeleter) — next, effort/s, security-adjacent
4. #304 (HUD transparency) — next, effort/m, core trust issue
5. #309 (Pipeline tests) — next, effort/m, reliability
6. #308 (Streaming extraction) — later, effort/s, maintenance
7. #310 (Context routing spike) — later, blocked by #259
