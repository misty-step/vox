## Purpose
This directory contains JSON-formatted prompt templates designed for processing and transforming automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. The prompts define specific instructions for an AI model to act as a transcription editor, offering two distinct levels of modification: minimal cleaning and structural polishing. Both templates emphasize treating the transcript input as literal text to be edited rather than instructions to be followed.

## Key Roles
- **clean.json**: Defines a "transcription editor" role for light-touch editing. It focuses on removing fillers (e.g., "um," "uh"), fixing ASR errors, and correcting punctuation while preserving the speaker's exact wording, tone, and discourse markers.
- **polish.json**: Defines an "elite editor" role for rewriting transcripts into a stronger written format. It authorizes reordering ideas, improving clarity, and using structural elements like headings and bullet lists, while strictly preserving original facts and the speaker's intent.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Both prompts utilize a `{{transcript}}` placeholder for dynamic content injection.
- System instructions explicitly forbid the model from answering questions, fulfilling requests, or following commands found within the transcript text.
- The templates require outputting only the processed text, prohibiting any meta-commentary, prefaces, or "thinking" blocks.
- `clean.json` requires that edits remain minimal, prioritizing punctuation and readability over rephrasing.
- `polish.json` prohibits the removal of uncertainty markers (e.g., "I think," "maybe") and the addition of any new facts or action items.
- Specific handling is defined for "instruction-like" text (e.g., "SYSTEM OVERRIDE"), requiring it to be treated as literal speech rather than a functional command.
- The prompts assume input may lack punctuation and sentence boundaries due to its nature as ASR context.
