## Purpose
This directory contains unit tests for the `VoxUI` module, focusing on UI state management, preference persistence, status bar rendering, and the debug workbench. It ensures that UI components correctly reflect system states, such as hotkey availability, dictation progress, and cloud provider configurations.

## Key Roles
- **DebugWorkbenchSinkTests.swift & DebugWorkbenchStoreTests.swift**: Validate the logging, request tracking, and state management within the debug workbench, including environment-based activation and log rotation.
- **HotkeyStateTests.swift**: Verifies hotkey availability tracking and its integration with the settings window controller.
- **OnboardingStoreTests.swift & OnboardingSessionExtensionTests.swift**: Test onboarding flow persistence and completion logic using `UserDefaults`.
- **PreferencesStoreCacheTests.swift & PreferencesStoreDefaultLevelTests.swift**: Ensure API key status is correctly cached and that default processing levels are assigned based on available providers.
- **SettingsViewContentTests.swift**: Validates the logic for generating text, version strings, and provider summaries displayed in the settings interface.
- **StatusBarIconRendererTests.swift & StatusBarMenuSnapshotTests.swift**: Test the visual representation, monogram styles, and menu state logic for the macOS status bar.
- **ShareVoxTests.swift**: Confirms the validity of repository URLs and clipboard strings for the sharing functionality.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on `VoxCore`, `VoxMac`, `VoxDiagnostics`, `AppKit`, and the `Testing` framework.
- `DebugWorkbenchRuntime` parses the `VOX_DEBUG_WORKBENCH` environment variable, recognizing truthy values such as "1", "true", "yes", or "on".
- `PreferencesStore` logic evaluates key status by checking both Keychain and environment variable overrides (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`).
- `DebugWorkbenchStore` implements a log tail that trims entries to a maximum of 150 lines.
- Status bar icons use specific monogram styles (`openV`, `outlinedTriangle`, `filledTriangle`) and require pixel alignment at 1x and 2x scales.
- UI components fall back to "Apple Speech (on-device)" or "Raw transcript" when no cloud providers are configured.
- `OnboardingStore` tests utilize transient `UserDefaults` suites to isolate persistence checks.
- Recovery actions in the status bar menu are conditionally enabled based on the presence of a recovery snapshot and the current processing state.
