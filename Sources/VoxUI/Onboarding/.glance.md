## Purpose
The `Sources/VoxUI/Onboarding` directory provides the user interface and state management for the application's initial setup process. It facilitates system permission verification, cloud service configuration, and tracks the completion of the user's first dictation.

## Key Roles
- **`OnboardingChecklistView`**: A SwiftUI view that displays a checklist for required system permissions (accessibility and microphone) and optional configurations, such as cloud provider API keys and microphone selection.
- **`OnboardingStore`**: An `ObservableObject` that manages and persists onboarding state, including whether the checklist has been shown and if the first dictation has been completed, using `UserDefaults`.
- **`OnboardingWindowController`**: An `NSWindowController` responsible for initializing the onboarding window and hosting the `OnboardingChecklistView`.
- **`OnboardingSessionExtension`**: A `VoxCore.SessionExtension` implementation that updates the `OnboardingStore` when a dictation event is successfully completed.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- **Permissions**: Relies on `PermissionManager` from the `VoxMac` module to check and request accessibility and microphone authorizations.
- **System Integration**: Uses `SystemSettingsLink` to direct users to macOS System Settings for privacy configuration.
- **API Key Configuration**: Checks for the presence of `elevenLabsAPIKey`, `deepgramAPIKey`, `geminiAPIKey`, and `openRouterAPIKey` within the `PreferencesStore` to determine cloud readiness.
- **Persistence**: Onboarding progress is stored in `UserDefaults` under the keys `onboarding.hasShownChecklist` and `onboarding.hasCompletedFirstDictation`.
- **UI Frameworks**: Built using `SwiftUI` and `AppKit`, utilizing `NSHostingController` for window management.
- **Functional Requirements**: Accessibility permission is explicitly noted as required to paste text into other applications.
- **External Sheets**: The interface triggers a `CloudKeysSheet` for managing third-party provider credentials.
