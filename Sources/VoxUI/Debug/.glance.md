## Purpose
This directory provides a debugging interface called the Vox Debug Workbench for monitoring and inspecting request processing. It enables the visualization of request lifecycles, including raw transcripts, rewritten text at various processing levels, and execution logs. The system comprises a centralized data store, a SwiftUI-based user interface, and a sink for routing events from the core logic to the display.

## Key Roles
- **DebugWorkbenchSink.swift**: Routes request events—such as status updates, logs, and transcript rewrites—to the data store and includes environment-based activation logic.
- **DebugWorkbenchStore.swift**: Acts as a thread-safe, main-actor-bound observable object that manages the state of up to 200 processing requests and their associated output panes.
- **DebugWorkbenchView.swift**: Defines the SwiftUI components for the workbench, including request cards, status badges, and interactive output panes with copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **DebugWorkbenchWindowController.swift**: Manages the lifecycle and configuration of the macOS floating window used to host the debug interface.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on `VoxCore` for shared types such as `ProcessingLevel`.
- Utilizes `AppKit` and `SwiftUI` for window management and interface rendering.
- The workbench is only active in `#if DEBUG` builds when the `VOX_DEBUG_WORKBENCH` environment variable is set to "1", "true", "yes", or "on".
- `DebugWorkbenchStore` enforces a limit of 200 requests and 150 log lines per request to manage memory.
- `DebugWorkbenchSink` uses asynchronous `Task` blocks to dispatch updates to the `@MainActor`.
- The UI explicitly tracks and displays three specific processing levels: raw, clean, and polish.
- Copy operations are performed directly via `NSPasteboard.general`.
