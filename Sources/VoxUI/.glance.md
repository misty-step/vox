## Purpose
This directory provides the user interface components, state management, and system integration for the Vox application. It facilitates the initial onboarding process, application configuration through a settings interface, and real-time interaction via a macOS status bar menu. Additionally, it includes a debug workbench for visualizing request lifecycles and processing logs.

## Key Roles
- **StatusBarController.swift**: Manages the macOS system status bar item, including dynamic menu generation, state transitions (idle, recording, processing), and routing actions such as diagnostic exports and dictation toggles.
- **SettingsWindowController.swift**: Controls the lifecycle of the settings window and coordinates the state of global hotkey availability within the UI.
- **StatusBarIconRenderer.swift**: Renders state-dependent icons using `NSBezierPath`, utilizing specific monogram styles like outlined or filled triangles to indicate recording and processing status.
- **OnboardingStore & OnboardingChecklistView**: Manage and display the initial setup flow, including system permission verification for the microphone and accessibility.
- **PreferencesStore.swift**: Acts as the central state manager for user preferences, handling persistence via `UserDefaults` and secure API key management.
- **DebugWorkbenchStore & DebugWorkbenchSink**: Manage and route request events to a specialized debugging interface for monitoring transcript rewrites and execution logs.
- **ShareVox.swift**: Provides static repository links and formatted strings for sharing the application via the system clipboard.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Relies on `VoxCore` for shared types like `ProcessingLevel` and `SessionExtension`.
- Utilizes `AppKit` and `SwiftUI` for window management, status bar integration, and interface rendering.
- Depends on `VoxMac` for `AudioDeviceObserver`, `KeychainHelper`, and `PermissionManager`.
- The Debug Workbench is only active in `#if DEBUG` builds when specific environment variables like `VOX_DEBUG_WORKBENCH` are enabled.
- API keys for cloud providers (e.g., Deepgram, Gemini, OpenRouter) are stored in the macOS Keychain, with environment variables acting as overrides in debug builds.
- Onboarding state and user preferences are persisted using `UserDefaults`.
- `DebugWorkbenchStore` enforces limits of 200 requests and 150 log lines per request to manage memory usage.
- Accessibility permissions are explicitly required to enable the application to paste text into other applications.
