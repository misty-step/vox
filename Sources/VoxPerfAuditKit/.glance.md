## Purpose
This directory provides the core configuration, execution planning, and statistical analysis utilities for a performance auditing system. It defines the structures for managing audit parameters, resolving Speech-to-Text (STT) and rewrite provider strategies based on environment availability, and calculating latency distributions for performance metrics.

## Key Roles
- **PerfAuditConfig.swift**: Defines the audit configuration structure and handles the parsing of command-line arguments and environment variables to set input paths, output destinations, and iteration counts.
- **PerfProviderPlan.swift**: Resolves the operational plan for STT and rewrite stages, determining provider chains and routing logic based on the presence of specific API keys in the environment.
- **StageDistribution.swift**: Provides statistical processing for performance samples, calculating minimum, maximum, p50, and p95 values.
- **PerfAuditError**: An error enumeration within the configuration file that handles missing paths, invalid arguments, and missing required API keys.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on the `Foundation` framework for file URL resolution, JSON coding support, and basic data types.
- Requires environment variables for provider authentication, specifically `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- STT provider selection is governed by a policy that defaults to "auto" but can be "forced" via the `VOX_PERF_STT_PROVIDER` environment variable.
- `PerfAuditLane` is restricted to two specific modes: `provider` and `codepath`.
- `StageDistribution` returns zeroed metrics if initialized with an empty sample set.
- The configuration initializer enforces that iterations must be greater than zero and warmup iterations must be non-negative.
- Rewrite routing logic is determined by the availability of the `GEMINI_API_KEY`, switching between "model-routed" and "openrouter" modes.
