## Purpose
The `Sources/VoxAppKit/Debug` directory provides a debugging interface for monitoring transcription and rewriting requests in real-time. It facilitates the inspection of request statuses, raw transcripts, and multiple processing levels such as "clean" and "polish" rewrites. The system captures logs and execution data into a centralized store that is rendered through a dedicated macOS window.

## Key Roles
- **DebugWorkbenchSink**: Provides a thread-safe interface for sending logs, status updates, and transcript data from processing logic to the underlying data store.
- **DebugWorkbenchStore**: Acts as a central `@MainActor` observable object that manages a collection of request records, enforcing limits on history size and log counts.
- **DebugWorkbenchView**: A SwiftUI component that renders the list of requests, status badges, and output panes for raw and processed text.
- **DebugWorkbenchWindowController**: Manages the lifecycle of a floating `NSWindow` used to host the debug interface.
- **DebugWorkbenchRuntime**: Contains logic to determine if the workbench is enabled based on build configuration and environment variables.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on `VoxCore` for shared types like `ProcessingLevel`.
- Utilizes `AppKit` and `SwiftUI` for window management and UI rendering.
- Activation is conditional on the `#if DEBUG` flag and the `VOX_DEBUG_WORKBENCH` environment variable.
- The store limits history to a maximum of 200 requests and 150 log lines per request.
- Data updates from the sink to the store are dispatched via `Task` to the `@MainActor`.
- Clipboard functionality is implemented using `NSPasteboard.general`.
