## Purpose
This directory provides the application-level lifecycle management and UI coordination for the Vox macOS application. It serves as the entry point for initializing core sessions, managing window controllers, and handling system-level integrations such as status bar menus and global hotkeys.

## Key Roles
- **AppDelegate.swift**: Orchestrates the application lifecycle by initializing the `VoxSession`, managing the `StatusBarController`, and coordinating window controllers for settings and onboarding. It handles system-wide hotkey registration, manages permissions through `PermissionManager`, and performs maintenance tasks such as cleaning up expired recovery audio files.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on `AppKit`, `Carbon`, `VoxCore`, `VoxDiagnostics`, `VoxMac`, `VoxSession`, and `VoxUI`.
- Requires system-level permissions for Accessibility and Microphone access to function.
- Registers a global hotkey (Option+Space) for toggling recording sessions.
- Relies on `PreferencesStore` for API key validation (ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Gemini, OpenRouter) and processing level configurations.
- Integrates with `VoxSession` to synchronize UI states with recording, processing, and idle phases.
- Automatically deletes recovery audio files older than 24 hours from the application support directory during launch.
- Includes a conditional debug workbench and sink that are enabled only in `DEBUG` build configurations.
