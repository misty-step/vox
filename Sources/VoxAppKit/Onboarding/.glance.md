## Purpose
This directory manages the application's onboarding process through a setup checklist and state tracking. It facilitates the verification of required system permissions, such as Accessibility and Microphone access, and monitors the completion of initial user tasks. The components coordinate to ensure the environment is configured for dictation and optional cloud-based features.

## Key Roles
- **OnboardingChecklistView.swift**: A SwiftUI view that provides a visual checklist for required permissions, optional cloud provider keys, and dictation testing.
- **OnboardingStore.swift**: An `ObservableObject` that manages and persists the state of the onboarding process, such as whether the checklist has been shown and if the first dictation is complete, using `UserDefaults`.
- **OnboardingWindowController.swift**: An `NSWindowController` responsible for initializing and displaying the onboarding interface within a standard macOS window.
- **OnboardingSessionExtension.swift**: A `SessionExtension` that updates the `OnboardingStore` when a dictation event is successfully completed.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on `AppKit` and `SwiftUI` for window management and interface construction.
- Integrates with `VoxCore` for session extensions and `VoxMac` for permission handling and system settings navigation.
- Relies on `PermissionManager` to verify and request system-level Accessibility and Microphone authorizations.
- Uses `PreferencesStore` to check for the presence of API keys for services including ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Gemini, and OpenRouter.
- Persists state via `UserDefaults` using specific keys: `onboarding.hasShownChecklist` and `onboarding.hasCompletedFirstDictation`.
- Monitors `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` to trigger UI refreshes when the user returns from System Settings.
- Employs a `CloudKeysSheet` for managing third-party API credentials within the onboarding flow.
