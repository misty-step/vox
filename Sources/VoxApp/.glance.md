## Purpose
The `Sources/VoxApp` directory contains the entry point for the application. It initializes the shared application instance, assigns a delegate, and configures the application's runtime behavior.

## Key Roles
- `main.swift`: Manages application initialization by setting the activation policy to `.accessory`, instantiating the `AppDelegate`, and starting the `NSApplication` run loop.

## Dependencies and Caveats
- Depends on the `AppKit` framework for `NSApplication` and activation policy management.
- Depends on `VoxAppKit` for the `AppDelegate` definition.
- Uses `MainActor.assumeIsolated` to instantiate the application delegate.
- Configures the application with an `.accessory` activation policy.
